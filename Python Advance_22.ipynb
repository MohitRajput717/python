    "Q1. What are the benefits of the built-in array package, if any?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The Array is much more rigid. That is, the items that an array contains must be of the same type. Therefore, the size of the item will also be the same. We can check the size of each item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What are some of the array package's limitations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: An array which is formed will be homogeneous.\n",
    "\n",
    "While declaring an array, passing size of an array is compulsory, and the size must be a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shifting is required for insertion or deletion of elements in an array\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Describe the main differences between the array and numpy packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: A numpy array is a grid of values, all of the same type, and is indexed by a tuple of nonnegative integers. A list is the Python equivalent of an array, but is resizeable and can contain elements of different types. The answer to above query the main difference in two is of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Explain the distinctions between the empty, ones, and zeros functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The only difference between numpy.empty numpy.ones and numpy.zeros is that empty uses malloc and zeros uses calloc. Also zeros() and ones() are the NumPy library functions to create two different arrays. zeros() function is used to create an array based on the particular shape and type. All array elements are initialized to 0, which is created by the zeros() function. ones() function works like the zeros() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. In the fromfunction function, which is used to construct new arrays, what is the role of the callable argument?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: fromfunction() function construct an array by executing a function over each coordinate and the resulting array, therefore, has a value fn(x, y, z) at coordinate (x, y, z). Parameters : function : [callable] The function is called with N parameters, where N is the rank of shape."

The elements in a NumPy array are all required to be of the same data type, and thus will be the same size in memory. if longer strings is allocateed it might cause a computation problem basically increse the time complexity."
