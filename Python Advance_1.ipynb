    "Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "Ans. Object-Oriented Programming makes the program easy to understand as well as efficient. Since the class is sharable, the code can be reused. Data is safe and secure with data abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "Ans. The whole point of a namespace tool like the class statement is to support name inheritance. In Python, inheritance happens when an object is qualified, and involves searching an attribute definition tree (one or more namespaces). Every time you use an expression of the form object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\n",
    "Ans. A class is a template for creating objects in program.The object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "A class is a logical entity.Object is a physical entity\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What makes the first argument in a classâ€™s method function special?\n",
    "Ans. The first argument of every class method, including init, is always a reference to the current instance of the class. By convention, this argument is always named self. In the init method, self refers to the newly created object; in other class methods, it refers to the instance whose method was called.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is the purpose of the __init__ method?\n",
    "Ans. \"__init__\" is a reseved method in python classes. It is called as a constructor in object oriented terminology. This method is called when an object is created from a class and it\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What is the process for creating a class instance?\n",
    "Ans. The new operator requires a single, postfix argument: a call to a constructor. The name of the constructor provides the name of the class to instantiate. The constructor initializes the new object. The new operator returns a reference to the object it created\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What is the process for creating a class?\n",
    "Ans. In Python, a class can be created by using the keyword class, followed by the class name. The syntax to create a class is given below. In Python, we must notice that each class is associated with a documentation string which can be accessed by using <class-name>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. How would you define the superclasses of a class?\n",
    "    Ans. A superclass is the class from which many subclasses can be created. The subclasses inherit the characteristics of a superclass. The superclass is also known as the parent class or base class. In the above example, Vehicle is the Superclass and its subclasses are Car, Truck and Motorcycle\n"
