    "Q2. What happens if you don't do something extra to treat an exception?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: When an exception occurred, if you don't handle it, the program terminates abruptly and the code past the line that caused the exception will not get executed. Because of not handling exceptions while deployment of end products users can face issues at their end while using the product.\n",
